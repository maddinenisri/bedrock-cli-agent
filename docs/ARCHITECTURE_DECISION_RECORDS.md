# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This document contains Architecture Decision Records for the MCP implementation improvements.

## ADR-001: Layered Architecture with Clean Separation of Concerns

**Status**: Accepted

**Context**: 
The current MCP implementation has tight coupling between transport, protocol, and application layers, making it difficult to test, extend, and maintain.

**Decision**: 
Implement a layered architecture with clear separation between:
- Application Layer (MCP Service Interface)
- Protocol Layer (Message Router, Session Manager, Tool Discovery)
- Transport Layer (Connection Pool, Message Dispatcher, Health Monitor)
- Infrastructure Layer (Config Manager, Observability, Error Recovery)

**Consequences**:
- **Positive**: Better testability, easier maintenance, clearer dependencies
- **Negative**: Initial complexity increase, more interfaces to manage
- **Risks**: Over-engineering for simple use cases

## ADR-002: Connection Pooling with Load Balancing

**Status**: Accepted

**Context**: 
Current implementation creates new connections for each MCP server interaction, leading to overhead and potential connection limits.

**Decision**: 
Implement connection pooling with:
- Configurable min/max connection limits per server
- Health monitoring and automatic reconnection
- Load balancing across available connections
- Connection lifecycle management

**Consequences**:
- **Positive**: Improved performance, better resource utilization, resilience
- **Negative**: Additional memory usage, complexity in connection management
- **Risks**: Connection leak potential, pool exhaustion scenarios

## ADR-003: Message Routing with Middleware Support

**Status**: Accepted

**Context**: 
Current message handling is embedded in client code, making cross-cutting concerns difficult to implement.

**Decision**: 
Implement a message router with:
- Pluggable middleware for logging, metrics, authentication
- Request correlation and timeout handling
- Type-safe routing with handler registration
- Support for notifications and events

**Consequences**:
- **Positive**: Extensible message processing, better observability
- **Negative**: Learning curve for middleware concepts
- **Risks**: Performance overhead from middleware chain

## ADR-004: Enhanced Tool Registry with Lifecycle Management

**Status**: Accepted

**Context**: 
Current tool registration is basic and doesn't handle tool discovery, validation, or lifecycle management effectively.

**Decision**: 
Implement enhanced tool registry with:
- Automated tool discovery and validation
- Tool lifecycle states (discovering, available, deprecated, etc.)
- Conflict resolution and compatibility checking
- Usage analytics and performance tracking

**Consequences**:
- **Positive**: Better tool management, conflict resolution, analytics
- **Negative**: Increased complexity in tool handling
- **Risks**: Tool validation failures breaking functionality

## ADR-005: Circuit Breaker and Error Recovery Patterns

**Status**: Accepted

**Context**: 
Current error handling is basic retry logic without sophisticated failure detection or recovery strategies.

**Decision**: 
Implement comprehensive error recovery with:
- Circuit breaker pattern for fault isolation
- Configurable retry policies with exponential backoff
- Error classification for different recovery strategies
- Fallback mechanisms for graceful degradation

**Consequences**:
- **Positive**: Improved resilience, better failure handling, system stability
- **Negative**: Configuration complexity, potential false positives
- **Risks**: Circuit breakers opening unnecessarily, masking real issues

## ADR-006: Hot-Reload Configuration Management

**Status**: Accepted

**Context**: 
Current configuration is loaded at startup and requires restarts for changes, limiting operational flexibility.

**Decision**: 
Implement dynamic configuration management with:
- Multiple configuration sources (files, environment, remote)
- Hot-reload without service restart
- Configuration validation and rollback
- Change notifications and audit trail

**Consequences**:
- **Positive**: Operational flexibility, reduced downtime, better DevOps experience
- **Negative**: Configuration complexity, potential runtime errors
- **Risks**: Invalid configurations causing service disruption

## ADR-007: Comprehensive Observability Layer

**Status**: Accepted

**Context**: 
Current observability is limited to basic logging, making debugging and monitoring difficult.

**Decision**: 
Implement comprehensive observability with:
- Distributed tracing with OpenTelemetry compatibility
- Prometheus-style metrics collection
- Structured logging with correlation IDs
- Health checks and alerting integration

**Consequences**:
- **Positive**: Better debugging, monitoring, operational insights
- **Negative**: Performance overhead, storage requirements
- **Risks**: Metrics explosion, trace sampling configuration

## ADR-008: Event-Driven Architecture with Pub/Sub

**Status**: Accepted

**Context**: 
Current architecture is primarily synchronous, making it difficult to implement reactive features and loose coupling.

**Decision**: 
Implement event-driven patterns with:
- Event publishing for configuration changes, tool lifecycle
- Subscription-based notifications
- Event sourcing for audit trails
- Asynchronous processing where appropriate

**Consequences**:
- **Positive**: Loose coupling, reactive capabilities, audit trails
- **Negative**: Complexity in event handling, eventual consistency
- **Risks**: Event ordering issues, message loss scenarios

## ADR-009: Backward Compatibility Strategy

**Status**: Accepted

**Context**: 
Need to maintain compatibility with existing MCP implementations while introducing architectural improvements.

**Decision**: 
Maintain backward compatibility through:
- Adapter pattern for existing tool interfaces
- Feature flags for gradual rollout
- Version negotiation for protocol differences
- Legacy mode support

**Consequences**:
- **Positive**: Smooth migration path, reduced deployment risk
- **Negative**: Code complexity, maintenance burden
- **Risks**: Technical debt accumulation, version fragmentation

## ADR-010: Phased Implementation Strategy

**Status**: Accepted

**Context**: 
The architectural improvements are extensive and need to be implemented without disrupting existing functionality.

**Decision**: 
Implement in phases:
1. Infrastructure layer (config, observability, error recovery)
2. Protocol layer (routing, sessions, discovery)
3. Service layer (facades, adapters, integration)
4. Optimization and cleanup

**Consequences**:
- **Positive**: Incremental value delivery, reduced risk, easier testing
- **Negative**: Longer overall timeline, temporary duplication
- **Risks**: Integration challenges between phases

## Implementation Guidelines

### Code Quality Standards
- All components must be unit testable in isolation
- Public APIs must have comprehensive documentation
