## Known Issues & Limitations

### Epic 2 Gaps
1. **No Response Caching**: All requests hit Bedrock API directly
   - Impact: Higher costs and latency
   - Priority: High (cost optimization)

2. **No Rate Limiting**: Potential for quota exhaustion
   - Impact: Service disruption, unexpected costs
   - Priority: High (production safety)

### Epic 4 Limitations
1. **AWS Bedrock Tool Limit**: Maximum ~64 tools per request
   - Solution: Implemented max_tools configuration with truncation
   - Status: Mitigated

2. **Tool Prioritization**: First-come basis for tool selection
   - Impact: Sub-optimal tool selection when limits exceeded
   - Priority: Medium (enhancement)

   - Reduce API costs and improve response times
   - Add LRU cache with configurable TTL

2. **Implement Rate Limiting** (Epic 2.4)
   - Prevent quota exhaustion
   - Add request queuing and graceful degradation

### Medium Priority (Enhancements)
3. **Tool Prioritization System** (Epic 4 enhancement)
   - Context-aware tool selection when hitting limits
   - Tool usage analytics and recommendations

4. **Advanced MCP Features**
   - WebSocket transport support
   - Tool result caching
   - Dynamic tool updates without restart

### Low Priority (Optimizations)
5. **Search Optimizations** (Epic 3 enhancements)
