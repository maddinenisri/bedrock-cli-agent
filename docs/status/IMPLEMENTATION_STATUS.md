# Implementation Status Overview

## System Components Status

### ✅ Fully Implemented & Working

#### Core Infrastructure
- **Workspace Setup**: All 8 crates properly configured
- **Core Types & Traits**: Task, TaskResult, Agent trait, UUID generation
- **Configuration System**: YAML config with env var substitution
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error types with context

#### AWS Bedrock Integration
- **Bedrock Client**: Full AWS credential chain support
- **Conversation API**: Single and streaming responses with tool support
- **Token Tracking**: Input/output token counting and cost calculation

#### Tool System
- **Tool Registry**: Thread-safe tool management
- **File Operations**: Read, write, list with security constraints
- **Search Tools**: Grep, find, ripgrep integration
- **Command Execution**: Bash/shell command support with safety controls
- **Permission System**: Configurable tool permissions

#### Additional Features
- **Streaming Support**: Full streaming with tool execution
- **Metrics System**: Token, cost, and latency tracking
- **Task Queue**: Priority-based task execution

### ⚠️ Partially Implemented (Has Issues)

#### MCP Integration
**Status**: Code exists but has critical bugs preventing proper operation

**Working Components**:
- Basic protocol communication
- Stdio and SSE transports
- Tool discovery from MCP servers
- Configuration loading

**Critical Issues**:
- ❌ Tool interface incompatible with AWS Bedrock
- ❌ Missing Document ↔ JSON type conversion
- ❌ Complex response handling with potential memory leaks
- ❌ Cannot execute MCP tools end-to-end

**Impact**: MCP features are non-functional for production use

### 📋 Not Implemented (Planned)

#### Caching System (Epic 2.3)
- LRU cache for conversation responses
- Cache key generation from requests
- Persistent cache storage
- Cache expiration policies
- Cache metrics and invalidation

#### Rate Limiting (Epic 2.4)
- Token-based rate limiting (TPM)
- Request-based rate limiting (RPM)
- Per-model configuration
- Request queuing when limited
- Burst capacity handling

|-----------|------------|---------|------------|-------|
| Core Types | ✅ Ready | ✅ Ready | ✅ Ready | Stable |
| Configuration | ✅ Ready | ✅ Ready | ✅ Ready | Stable |
| AWS Client | ✅ Ready | ✅ Ready | ✅ Ready | Stable |
| Tool System | ✅ Ready | ✅ Ready | ✅ Ready | Stable |
| Streaming | ✅ Ready | ✅ Ready | ✅ Ready | Stable |

## Dependencies & External Systems

### Required (Working)
- ✅ AWS Bedrock Runtime API
- ✅ AWS Credentials (IAM, profile, env vars)
- ✅ Tokio async runtime
- ✅ File system access (with sandboxing)

### Optional (Status Varies)
- ⚠️ MCP Servers (connection works, execution fails)
- ✅ Ripgrep binary (for search tools)
- ✅ Shell/Bash (for command execution)

### Future Dependencies
- 📋 Cache storage backend
- 📋 Rate limit state store
- 📋 Metrics aggregation system

## Testing Coverage

### Unit Tests
- ✅ Core types and traits
- ✅ Configuration parsing
- ✅ Tool implementations
- ⚠️ MCP components (partial)
- ❌ End-to-end MCP integration

### Integration Tests
- ✅ AWS Bedrock communication
- ✅ Tool execution
- ✅ Streaming responses
- ❌ MCP tool execution
- ❌ Production scenarios

### Example Programs
- ✅ `simple_task.rs` - Basic task execution
- ✅ `cli_demo.rs` - CLI interface demo
- ⚠️ `mcp_demo.rs` - MCP demo (connection only)
- ❌ `test_mcp_tool_execution.rs` - Fails

## Known Limitations

### Current System
1. No response caching (increased costs)
2. No rate limiting (potential for hitting AWS limits)
3. MCP tools cannot be used
4. Limited to built-in tools only
5. No connection pooling for MCP

### Workarounds Available
1. Use only built-in tools (fs, search, bash)
2. Implement client-side rate limiting
3. Monitor token usage manually
4. Cache responses externally if needed

## Production Readiness Assessment

### ✅ Ready for Production
- Core agent functionality
- AWS Bedrock integration
- Built-in tool system
- Streaming responses
- Basic metrics

### ⚠️ Use with Caution
- High token usage scenarios (no caching)
- High request volume (no rate limiting)
- Cost optimization needed

### ❌ Not Production Ready
- MCP integration
- External tool servers
- Complex tool workflows

## Recommended Deployment Configuration

```yaml
# Safe production configuration
agent:
  name: "bedrock-agent"
  model: "anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0"
  max_tokens: 4096
  temperature: 0.7

aws:
  region: "us-east-1"

tools:
  allowed:
    - fs_read
    - fs_write
    - fs_list
    - grep
    - find
    - execute_bash

# Disable MCP until fixed
mcp:
  enabled: false

paths:
  workspace_dir: "/app/workspace"
  home_dir: "/app/config"
```

## Next Development Priorities

1. **Immediate (Critical)**:
   - Fix MCP tool interface
   - Add Document type conversion

2. **Short Term (1-2 weeks)**:
   - Implement caching layer
   - Add rate limiting

3. **Medium Term (1 month)**:
   - Fix MCP issues completely
   - Add connection pooling
   - Improve error handling

4. **Long Term (2-3 months)**:
   - Advanced caching strategies
   - Distributed rate limiting
   - Full observability suite
