# MCP (Model Context Protocol) Integration

## Current Status: ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIALLY FUNCTIONAL

While MCP implementation code exists and basic functionality has been developed, there are **critical integration issues** that prevent full operation with AWS Bedrock.

## Quick Status Summary

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Core Protocol | ‚úÖ Implemented | JSON-RPC 2.0 messages working |
| Stdio Transport | ‚úÖ Implemented | Process communication functional |
| SSE Transport | ‚úÖ Implemented | HTTP SSE client working |
| Tool Discovery | ‚úÖ Implemented | Can list tools from MCP servers |
| Tool Registration | ‚úÖ Implemented | Tools register with registry |
| **Tool Execution** | ‚ùå **BROKEN** | **Critical: Incompatible with AWS Bedrock** |
| **Type Conversion** | ‚ùå **MISSING** | **Critical: No Document ‚Üî JSON conversion** |
| Health Monitoring | ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial | Basic health checks, needs improvement |
| Configuration | ‚úÖ Implemented | YAML config with env var support |

## Critical Issues Preventing Full Operation

### üö® Issue #1: Tool Interface Incompatibility
The `McpToolWrapper` doesn't match the `bedrock-tools::Tool` trait interface:
- **Expected**: `async fn execute(&self, input: &Document) -> Result<Value>`
- **Actual**: `async fn execute(&self, args: Value) -> Result<Value>`
- **Impact**: Runtime failures when executing MCP tools through Bedrock

### üö® Issue #2: Missing AWS Document Type Conversion
No implementation for converting between AWS `Document` and JSON `Value`:
- Bedrock sends tool inputs as `aws_smithy_types::Document`
- MCP expects `serde_json::Value`
- **Impact**: Cannot process tool inputs from Bedrock

### üö® Issue #3: Response Correlation Complexity
Current implementation uses complex channel-based response handling:
- Spawned background tasks for response processing
- Potential memory leaks from uncleaned pending requests
- **Impact**: Performance issues and potential crashes

## What Actually Works

Despite the critical issues, the following components are functional:

1. **MCP Server Connection**: Can connect to both stdio and SSE-based MCP servers
2. **Protocol Communication**: JSON-RPC 2.0 message exchange works
3. **Tool Discovery**: Successfully discovers and lists tools from MCP servers
4. **Configuration**: Environment variable substitution and server configuration

## What Doesn't Work

1. **End-to-End Tool Execution**: Cannot execute MCP tools from Bedrock due to type mismatches
2. **Production Deployment**: Not safe for production use due to unresolved issues
3. **Complex Tool Workflows**: Multi-step tool interactions will fail

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Fix tool interface to match bedrock-tools trait
2. **Critical**: Implement Document ‚Üî JSON conversion helpers
3. **Important**: Simplify response handling mechanism
4. **Enhancement**: Add comprehensive testing suite
