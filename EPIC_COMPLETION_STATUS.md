# Epic Completion Status

## Epic 1: Core Infrastructure - Foundation crates and configuration
**Status: COMPLETED ✅**

### Story 1.1: Workspace Setup ✅
- ✅ Created Cargo workspace with root Cargo.toml
- ✅ Initialized all 8 crates with proper Cargo.toml files
- ✅ Configured workspace dependencies and features
- ✅ Set up common dependencies (tokio, serde, etc.)
- ✅ All crates compile successfully with `cargo build`
- ✅ Workspace passes `cargo check` and `cargo clippy`

### Story 1.2: Core Types & Traits ✅
- ✅ Defined Task struct with UUID task_id field
- ✅ Defined TaskResult struct with summary, status, task_id
- ✅ Defined Agent trait with async execute method
- ✅ Implemented UUID generation for task_id
- ✅ Added serialization/deserialization for all types
- ✅ Created TaskStatus enum (Pending, Running, Completed, Failed, Cancelled)
- ✅ Added token statistics types (TokenStatistics, CostDetails)

### Story 1.3: Configuration System ✅
- ✅ Defined AgentConfig struct with all configuration fields
- ✅ Implemented YAML deserialization with serde_yaml
- ✅ Load config from $HOME_DIR/agent.yaml (with default path support)
- ✅ Support WORKSPACE_DIR and HOME_DIR environment variables
- ✅ Implemented config validation with defaults
- ✅ Support for environment variable substitution (${VAR:-default} pattern)
- ✅ Added model pricing configuration support

### Story 1.4: Error Handling ✅
- ✅ Defined custom error types with thiserror
- ✅ Created error types for each domain (ConfigError, AwsError, ToolError, TaskError, IoError, JsonError, Unknown)
- ✅ Added error conversion traits (From implementations)
- ✅ Comprehensive error context throughout codebase

## Epic 2: AWS Bedrock Integration - Client and caching
**Status: PARTIALLY COMPLETED (50%)**

### Story 2.1: Bedrock Client ✅
- ✅ Implemented AWS credential chain support
- ✅ Support profile-based authentication
- ✅ Support IRSA (through SDK credential chain)
- ✅ Support environment variable credentials
- ✅ Created BedrockClient struct with region configuration
- ✅ Validate credentials on client initialization

### Story 2.2: Conversation API ✅
- ✅ Implemented converse method for single responses
- ✅ Implemented converse_stream for streaming responses
- ✅ Handle tool calls in conversations
- ✅ Support system prompts and user messages
- ✅ Parse and handle Bedrock response formats
- ✅ Support multiple message turns in conversation
- ✅ Handle content blocks (text, tool_use, tool_result)

### Story 2.3: Caching Layer ❌
- ⬜ Implement LRU cache for conversation responses
- ⬜ Create cache key generation from request parameters
- ⬜ Store cache in $HOME_DIR/cache directory
- ⬜ Implement cache expiration policies
- ⬜ Add cache hit/miss metrics
- ⬜ Support cache invalidation commands
- ⬜ Persist cache across agent restarts

### Story 2.4: Rate Limiting ❌
- ⬜ Implement token-based rate limiting (TPM)
- ⬜ Implement request-based rate limiting (RPM)
- ⬜ Configure limits per model from agent.yaml
- ⬜ Queue requests when rate limit is reached
- ⬜ Add rate limit metrics and logging
- ⬜ Support burst capacity handling
- ⬜ Implement graceful degradation when limited
